Unexplained infertility is one of the most frustrating things for couples. Like, everything looks normal â€” the woman is ovulating, the manâ€™s sperm is fine, the fallopian tubes are open â€” but still, no pregnancy. It feels confusing and emotionally draining. Thatâ€™s where expert help really matters.

At Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, couples dealing with unexplained infertility are given careful attention. Dr. Krupa Shah and her team take the time to dig deeper. Sometimes, regular tests donâ€™t show the real reason. Thatâ€™s why the clinic uses advanced diagnostics â€” like checking for egg quality, doing hysteroscopy to look inside the uterus, and checking the sperm DNA fragmentation level, which basic semen analysis may miss.

Another thing Ayuh does is personalise the treatment. They donâ€™t just push everyone into IVF right away. In many cases, they try simpler options first, like ovulation induction with timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI), especially if the woman is young and has a regular cycle. If those don't work after a few tries, they discuss IVF or ICSI as the next step.

For unexplained infertility, IVF can be very helpful because it gives a chance to observe how the eggs are fertilising and whether embryos are developing properly in the lab. If thereâ€™s an issue during fertilisation or early embryo development, doctors can identify it and take action. The team at Ayuh Fertility is very careful with embryo grading and transfer timing, which improves the chance of success.

Ayuh Fertility also looks at lifestyle factors. Sometimes, things like stress, being overweight, thyroid issues, or poor sleep can mess with fertility without showing up in reports. So the team gives support on diet, exercise, and emotional health too. Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all solution, and thatâ€™s what they understand really well.

The best part is, couples are never rushed or judged. The doctors explain all the options, the risks, and even when it's better to wait. That kind of honest and patient-focused approach really helps reduce anxiety â€” which itself can sometimes improve fertility chances!
